            4. **Quantitative Insights** ‚Äì Include key statistics, charts, or benchmarks (e.g., market size, adoption rates, funding rounds, or user growth).
            5. **Source Validation** ‚Äì Prioritize high-authority, non-user-generated sources. Cross-check facts using at least two independent sources where possible.
            6. **Contextual Background** ‚Äì Add historical or conceptual framing that enhances understanding of current developments.

            Your deliverable should exhibit:
            1. **Narrative Structure**
               - Title: Use H1 markdown (`# Title`) that is concise and SEO-aware.
               - Introduction: Set context and articulate why the topic matters.
               - Body: Organize into thematic H3 (`###`) sections. Present key insights with clarity and flow.
               - Conclusion: Summarize implications, potential next steps, or open questions.
            
            2. **Writing Style**
               - Maintain an informative yet accessible tone; balance technical accuracy with readability.
               - Break long paragraphs into digestible chunks; use lists where appropriate.
               - Apply rhetorical techniques (e.g., analogies, transitions, parallelism) to enhance engagement.
            
            3. **Citation and Attribution**
               - Integrate hyperlinks for all facts, statistics, or quotes using `[Source](URL)` inline markdown style.
               - Include a dedicated **References** section listing all sources.
            
            4. **Markdown Compliance**
               - Ensure proper heading hierarchy (`#`, `###`)
               - Use bolding, bullet lists, and links appropriately
               - Ensure that the final output is render-ready for newsletters and newsletters and blog platforms like Medium, Ghost, or Notion.
